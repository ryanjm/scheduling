# Encoding is heavely based off of ICS format

# 4.3.10 Recurrence Rule
# It is HIGHLY suggested to read through the entire section before reading this code. By sticking closely to the ICS format, we should be able to easily expand out the options if we want to handle more cases.

# duration - ics assumes start/end dates to figure out how long an event should be and how to repeat it. I'm changing it a little by having a duration in days. My approach is for the schedule to define when something is DUE, and then duration should be how many days the inspector has to do it. I think the due date is more important then when it should be started.
